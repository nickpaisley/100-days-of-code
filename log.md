# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 11th, Sunday, 2019

**Today's Progress:** 

Created a repo for Hangry, my LaunchCode Liftoff capstone project. This has a basic
functioning HelloWorld Java/Spring app inside.  
Updated Trello with more user stories. 
I invested in myself and signed up for LinkedIn Premium and started a Spring course, Learning Spring with Spring Boot. 

**Thoughts:**

I still worry about where to start and which technologies to use. But I will take it one step at a time. 
I need to work on solid blocks of time, not just working when I have "free" time or when kids are not requiring lots of attention. 
I need to stop wondering about all of the technologies and IDEs, all the side projects and just BUILD!

### Day 1: August 12th, Monday, 2019
Committed to 2 more daily challenges, 30 days of code on HackerRank and #javascript30. 
Got a base Java/Spring hello world application running for my #launchcode101 capstone. 
To infinity and beyond!

### Day 2: August 13rd, Tuesday, 2019
D2 of #100DaysOfCode  - Halfway through a Spring Boot course and setup Spring Tool Suite 3 to try out the Eclipse side of the Java IDE world. 
Completed day 2 of #javascript30. Wasn't sure what to really expect of JavaScript but it's fascinating and overwhelming! 
Engage!

### Day 3-5: August 14-16, Wed-Friday 2019
D3-5, #100DaysOfCode #MidnightClub 
D3-4 was spent reading about what to do more than doing. Not sure that counts towards work. I took a step back on D2 of #JS30 and redid it, playing around instead of rushing through it. Spent more time with Eclipse. 

Learning to learn.

### Day 6-7: August 17-28, Saturday-Sunday 2019
D6-D7 #100DaysOfCode
Explored Spring development inside VScode. Started converting my automotive resume to tech. 
Analyzed a bug(ish) issue in D1 of #JS30 with a mentor, going to attempt my own fix. 
Created basic User Login functionaltiy in my capstone project. User registration is next.
I used Spring Tool Suite for that since it found some errors that VSCode did not.
