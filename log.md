# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 11, 2019

**Today's Progress:** 

Created a repo for Hangry, my LaunchCode Liftoff capstone project. This has a basic
functioning HelloWorld Java/Spring app inside.  
Updated Trello with more user stories. 
I invested in myself and signed up for LinkedIn Premium and started a Spring course, Learning Spring with Spring Boot. 

**Thoughts:**

I still worry about where to start and which technologies to use. But I will take it one step at a time. 
I need to work on solid blocks of time, not just working when I have "free" time or when kids are not requiring lots of attention. 
I need to stop wondering about all of the technologies and IDEs, all the side projects and just BUILD!
